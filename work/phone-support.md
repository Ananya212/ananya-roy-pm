title: Phone Support for DevRev
subtitle: 0→1 launch of phone support to unblock India-first SMB adoption
---

## Context

### Company
DevRev  
**Product:** Support App  
**Role:** Product Manager  
**Scope:** 0→1, Vendor-led

---

## The problem

> “We love the product — but where’s the phone line?”

Despite strong interest, **sales deals were stalling** because the Support App lacked phone support.

- 80–90% of Indian SMBs rely on phone-based support  
- Voice is preferred for **urgent and complex issues**  
- Competing tools offered phone support by default  

Without voice, DevRev wasn’t even considered.

---

## Key insight

> **Phone support isn’t just another channel — it’s a trust signal in India.**

---

## Second-order problem

Even when calls worked well, agents spent **more time after calls**:
- Notes
- Ticket linking
- Tagging

This hurt resolution time and efficiency.

---

## The decision: Build vs Buy

### Build
- Full branding control  
- High infra & compliance cost  
- Slow time to market  

### Buy
- Faster launch  
- Battle-tested reliability  
- Branding tradeoffs  

**Call:** Buy. Speed mattered more than control.

## Vendor evaluation

**Twilio vs Amazon Connect**

**Why Amazon Connect won:**
- Native AWS integration (already trusted)
- Clear India expansion roadmap
- Transparent usage-based pricing
- Enterprise-grade reliability

I aligned engineering, leadership, and sales before the final recommendation.

---

## Execution highlights

- Onboarded **3 customer segments**
- Native UI integration with DevRev
- AI-powered post-call automation (notes, ticket linking, tagging)

This became the **“wow moment”** in product demos.
