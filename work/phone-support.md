# Giving Customers a Voice — Literally
### 0→1 Phone Support for DevRev’s Support App

**Role:** Product Manager  
**Scope:** 0→1 Platform Feature  
**Market:** India + Global

---

## “Great product—but where’s phone support?”

Despite strong interest in the Support App, sales conversations—especially in India—
repeatedly stalled due to the absence of phone support.

- **80–90%** of Indian SMBs rely on phone support  
- **65%** prefer voice for complex issues  
- Deals dropped before onboarding

---

## Key Insight

> Voice isn’t just another channel—it’s the most trusted and human way to resolve issues.  
> Without it, the Support App couldn’t compete in India or enterprise sales cycles.

**Build**

**Buy**
