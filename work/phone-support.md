<div class="case-container">
  
## Giving customers a voice — literally

**0→1 launch of phone support** in DevRev’s Support App to unblock India-first SMB adoption and close high-intent deals.

### 📌 Context

<div class="context-grid">
  <div><strong>Company</strong><br>DevRev</div>
  <div><strong>Product</strong><br>Support App</div>
  <div><strong>My role</strong><br>Product Manager</div>
  <div><strong>Scope</strong><br>0→1, Vendor-led</div>
</div>

## The problem

> “We love the product — but where’s the phone line?”

Despite strong interest, **sales deals were stalling** because the Support App lacked a phone channel.

- 80–90% of Indian SMBs rely on phone-based support  
- Voice is preferred for **urgent and complex issues**
- Competing tools offered phone support by default

Without voice, DevRev wasn’t even considered.

---

## Key insight

<div class="highlight">
Phone support isn’t just another channel —  
<strong>it’s a trust signal in India</strong>.
</div>

Additionally, we uncovered a second-order problem:
- Agents spent **more time after calls** (notes, tagging, ticket linking)
- This hurt resolution time and agent efficiency

## The decision: Build vs Buy

<div class="two-col">
  <div>
    <h4>Build</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Full branding control</li>
      <li>High infra & compliance cost</li>
      <li>Slow time to market</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h4>Buy</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Faster launch</li>
      <li>Battle-tested reliability</li>
      <li>Tradeoff on branding</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

**Call:** Buy  
Speed mattered more than control.

## Vendor evaluation

We shortlisted **Twilio vs Amazon Connect**.

**Why Amazon Connect won:**
- Native AWS integration (already trusted)
- Clear India expansion roadmap
- Transparent usage-based pricing
- Enterprise-grade reliability

I aligned engineering, leadership, and sales before final recommendation.
